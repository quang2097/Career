1. Core IT Skills (Still Essential)
Even in an AI era, you can’t skip the fundamentals:

Networking

TCP/IP, DNS, DHCP, HTTP/HTTPS

Firewalls, VPN, load balancers

Operating Systems

Windows Server & Active Directory

Linux administration (shell, permissions, security)

Databases

SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL)

Basic NoSQL (MongoDB, Redis)

Cloud Platforms

AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud basics

VM setup, storage, security groups

Scripting & Automation

Bash/PowerShell for sysadmin automation

Python for cross-platform tasks

2. AI-Related Knowledge for IT
AI is becoming a core tool in IT workflows — you don’t need to be a data scientist, but you do need to know how to work with AI-powered systems.

AI concepts:

Machine learning vs. deep learning

NLP, computer vision basics

AI model lifecycle (training, deployment, monitoring)

AI tools in IT:

AI-assisted monitoring (e.g., Splunk with AI)

ChatOps & AI-driven incident response

AI in cybersecurity (threat detection, anomaly spotting)

APIs & integration:

How to use AI APIs (OpenAI, Hugging Face, Azure AI)

Building AI-powered chatbots for support

3. Automation & DevOps
AI thrives in automated, scalable environments — IT teams now blend sysadmin work with DevOps skills:

Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Ansible)

CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)

Containerization (Docker, Kubernetes)

Monitoring & logging (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack with AI anomaly detection)

4. Cybersecurity in the AI Era
AI brings new security risks — IT pros need hybrid knowledge:

Security fundamentals (CIA triad, encryption, authentication)

AI-specific security:

Model poisoning & prompt injection risks

Protecting AI APIs

Modern defense tools:

AI-powered SIEMs (e.g., Sentinel, Splunk AI)

Threat hunting with machine learning

5. Soft Skills & Adaptability
Prompt engineering — knowing how to query AI effectively for IT tasks

Critical thinking — AI can be wrong, you need to validate

Collaboration — bridging AI engineers, sysadmins, and business teams
