1. Core IT Fundamentals (Your Foundation)
You can’t secure what you don’t understand.

Networking basics:

TCP/IP, UDP, DNS, HTTP/HTTPS

Subnetting, routing, and NAT

Common ports & protocols (FTP, SSH, SMTP, etc.)

Operating systems:

Windows security (Active Directory, Group Policy)

Linux security (permissions, SELinux, iptables)

System administration:

User account management

File system permissions

Process monitoring

Scripting/programming (for automation & analysis):

Python, Bash, or PowerShell

2. Security Fundamentals
CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)

Authentication & authorization

Encryption & hashing:

Symmetric vs. asymmetric encryption

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

Common algorithms (AES, RSA, SHA-256)

Security models & principles:

Least privilege

Defense in depth

Zero trust

Common threats:

Malware, phishing, ransomware

Insider threats

DDoS attacks

3. Security Tools
Hands-on familiarity with:

Network monitoring & analysis: Wireshark, tcpdump

Vulnerability scanning: Nessus, OpenVAS

Penetration testing: Metasploit, Burp Suite

Endpoint protection: Antivirus/EDR tools

SIEM platforms: Splunk, ELK Stack

Firewalls & IDS/IPS: pfSense, Snort, Suricata

4. Cybersecurity Domains (as defined by industry)
Employers often align expectations with frameworks like CompTIA Security+ or NIST:

Network security

Application security

Cloud security

Identity & access management

Incident detection & response

Risk assessment & compliance (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, ISO 27001)

5. Practical Skills Employers Test
Analyzing suspicious network traffic

Detecting & mitigating SQL injection or XSS

Hardening a Linux/Windows system

Conducting basic penetration tests

Investigating a simulated security incident

6. Recommended Entry-Level Certifications
While not strictly required, these can boost your chances:

CompTIA Security+ (broad foundation)

Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) (offensive security basics)

Cisco CCNA Security (network-focused)

Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate (new, practical)

7. Mindset & Soft Skills
Analytical thinking — spotting patterns in logs/data.

Attention to detail — small mistakes can mean big breaches.

Continuous learning — threats evolve, so should you.

Incident communication — clearly explaining security issues to non-technical stakeholders.
