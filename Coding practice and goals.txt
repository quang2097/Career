Great questions — here's a focused strategy to help you land a junior developer position, along with what technologies (like MySQL or others) are actually in demand today.

✅ 1. Skills You Need for a Junior Position (2025)
🧠 Core Knowledge
Programming language: Pick one strong language that’s widely used:

JavaScript (great for frontend/backend jobs)

Python (great for backend, scripting, data)

Java / C# (enterprise, mobile, backend)

Version control: Git + GitHub (mandatory)

Data structures & algorithms: Basics are a must

🗃️ Databases (YES, MySQL counts)
MySQL / PostgreSQL – important for backend jobs

MongoDB – common in full-stack JavaScript (Node.js + Mongo)

Learn basic CRUD, joins, indexing, normalization

🎯 Is MySQL required?
Not required everywhere, but definitely helpful — most backend or full-stack jobs expect SQL familiarity (MySQL or PostgreSQL). You don’t need to be an expert, just able to write:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT name FROM users WHERE age > 25 ORDER BY created_at DESC;
💼 2. Languages & Tools Popular in the Job Market (2025)
🧑‍💻 Backend
JavaScript (Node.js)

Python (Django, FastAPI)

Java (Spring Boot)

C# (.NET Core)

Go (more in startups, backend)

🎨 Frontend
HTML/CSS/JavaScript

React.js (by far the most demanded)

Bonus: Next.js, Vue.js, Angular

📦 DevOps / Tools
Docker (basic usage is helpful)

GitHub Actions or CI/CD knowledge

REST APIs and JSON

🛠️ Full-Stack
MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) – very employable

Django + React

Spring Boot + Angular

📈 3. Steps to Get a Junior Developer Job
✅ Pick a track: Frontend, backend, or full-stack.

💻 Build 2–3 solid projects (e.g., blog, e-commerce site, dashboard)

🧾 Publish code on GitHub – show clean code, commits, README

🌐 Create a portfolio website

💬 Prepare for interviews:

Basic algorithms (Leetcode easy/medium)

Behavioral questions

Project explanation

🔎 Apply smart:

Use LinkedIn, Indeed, and job boards

Filter for “Junior”, “Entry-Level”, “Intern” roles

Tailor your resume to each job

📚 Optional certifications (if helpful in your region)

Meta Front-End/Back-End Dev (Coursera)

Google IT Certs

AWS Cloud Practitioner

💬 Final Tip
If you're not sure where to start, here's a safe combo:

Language: JavaScript or Python

Frameworks: React (frontend), Node.js or Django (backend)

Database: MySQL or PostgreSQL

Bonus: Build + deploy a full-stack app (Netlify + Render or Railway)
