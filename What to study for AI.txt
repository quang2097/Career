1. Build Your Foundations
Before diving in, you’ll want:

Math basics: Linear algebra, probability, statistics (you don’t need PhD depth, just enough to understand algorithms).

Python: It’s the go-to language for AI/ML.

Data handling: Using pandas and numpy for data manipulation.

2. Start With “Applied AI”
You don’t need to reinvent deep learning from scratch — start with practical projects using existing tools.

Steps:

Pick a domain you care about:

Text (chatbots, summarization, translation) → Natural Language Processing

Images (recognition, object detection) → Computer Vision

Data predictions (sales forecasts, fraud detection) → Machine Learning

Use high-level libraries:

Scikit-learn → Beginner-friendly for ML.

TensorFlow or PyTorch → For deep learning.

Hugging Face → For state-of-the-art NLP models.

Build small projects:

Spam email classifier.

Image classifier for cats vs. dogs.

Simple movie recommender.

3. Understand the AI Development Workflow
AI projects typically follow:

Collect & clean data → get CSVs, APIs, or web-scraped data.

Choose & train a model → use an algorithm suited to your problem.

Evaluate & improve → tweak hyperparameters, try different architectures.

Deploy → wrap it into a web API, mobile app, or automation tool.

4. Learn by Doing
Kaggle → Practice on real datasets.

Colab Notebooks → Run Python + AI code in the cloud for free.

Open-source repos → Fork projects and experiment.

5. Work Toward Real Deployment
Once you’re comfortable:

Learn model serving (FastAPI, Flask, Django).

Explore cloud AI services (AWS Sagemaker, Azure AI, Google Vertex AI).

Build something end-to-end: Data → Model → API → Frontend.

💡 Mindset tip: Don’t start with “I need to understand all the math first.”
Start building small things now, and let the theory sink in as you go.
